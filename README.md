# MiscreatedSteamWorkshopUploader
A generic, bare-bones app made in Unity3D for letting players upload mods to Steam Workshop for your game. Unfortunately, this is not something Valve provides a tool for; you can modify existing Workshop items but you can't actually create them or upload content for them without using the Steam API. The uploader saves you from that hassle.

Right now everything included will work as-is for the Steam API demo game "SpaceWar" (app id 480), but due to the way the Steam API works, it should work just fine on any other game simply by changing the app id. I've even tested it myself with Skyrim.

Thanks goes to [rlabrecque](https://github.com/rlabrecque), none of this would work without [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET).

### Downloads

#### Build 10

[Windows](https://github.com/zen0bit/SteamWorkshopUploader/releases/download/Build10/SteamWorkshopUploader_10_win.zip)

[Mac](https://github.com/zen0bit/SteamWorkshopUploader/releases/download/Build10/SteamWorkshopUploader_10_mac.zip)

### Setup

Make sure you're logged into the Steam client, otherwise nothing will work.

Edit "steam_appid.txt" to match your game's app id.

Edit "config.json" to match your workshop settings. For example, if you use predefined tags, be sure to define them and set "validateTags" to true.

### Distributing to modders

Be sure to include these files in builds you distribute:

- config.json
- steam_appid.txt
- steam_api.dll (Steamworks.NET should do this automatically)
- UnityPlayer.dll
- WorkshopContent/
- Optionally: an example mod or two in WorkshopContent/ so modders can understand the format of .workshop.json files.

### KNOWN ISSUES

Sometimes it seems that users are unable to upload things and get an "invalid item" error. I have discovered a single possible cause which the uploader should handle and complain about in the status bar: if "steam_appid.txt" doesn't exist, or has an invalid id (such as 0), or for some reason the uploader is unable to load the file, and thus has no app ID to use.

However, it's possible it could happen in other situations. Sometimes users are able to resolve it by doing seemingly random things like choosing a different preview image or making other seemingly random changes to the content itself. Usually, if another user uploads the same content as-is there are no problems, so I'm unable to verify if the issue is with SteamWorkshopUploader or Steam itself. I've been talking to Valve about this but have been unable to determine a cause or potential fixes.

If you use this uploader for your own game and find your players run into this same issue, but are able to figure out some solution or workaround, PLEASE get in contact or create a pull request, it would be greatly appreciated.
